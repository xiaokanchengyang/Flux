## Release Process

### 1. Final Testing
```bash
# Run the local release test
./scripts/test_release.sh

# Build all targets locally
cargo build --release --all

# Run full test suite
cargo test --all --release
```

### 2. Create Git Tag
```bash
# Ensure you're on main branch with latest changes
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create annotated tag
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0

- Initial stable release
- Smart compression strategy
- Cross-platform support
- TAR and ZIP archive formats
- Multiple compression algorithms

See CHANGELOG.md for full details."

# Verify the tag
git show v1.0.0
```

### 3. Push to GitHub
```bash
# Push the tag to trigger release workflow
git push origin v1.0.0
```

### 4. Monitor Release

1. Go to GitHub Actions tab
2. Watch the "Release" workflow
3. Ensure all platform builds complete successfully
4. Check that artifacts are uploaded to the release

### 5. Post-Release

- [ ] Verify GitHub Release page looks correct
- [ ] Download and test binaries from each platform
- [ ] Verify crates.io publication (if configured)

## Rollback Plan

If something goes wrong:

1. Delete the tag locally and remotely:
   ```bash
   git tag -d v1.0.0
   git push origin :refs/tags/v1.0.0
   ```

2. Fix the issue

3. Start the release process again

## Future Releases

For future releases:
1. Update version numbers
2. Add new changelog entry
3. Follow this same process
4. Consider automating more steps

## Notes

- The GitHub Release workflow automatically creates release notes from the tag
