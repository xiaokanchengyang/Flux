  - Unified file/cloud browser
  - Streaming compression/decompression
  
- [ ] **Account Management**
  - Secure credential storage
  - Multiple account support
  - Usage analytics

#### 4.3 Smart Sync Features
- [ ] **Incremental Sync**
  - Delta compression
  - Bandwidth optimization
  - Conflict resolution
  
- [ ] **Sync Profiles**
  - Scheduled backups
  - Multi-destination sync
  - Rule-based filtering

## Technical Architecture Evolution

### Current Architecture
```
flux-workspace/
├── flux-lib/        # Core library (sync)
├── flux-cli/        # CLI application
└── flux-gui/        # GUI application
```

### Target Architecture
```
flux-workspace/
├── flux-core/       # Async core library
│   ├── compression/ # Algorithm implementations
│   ├── cloud/       # Cloud storage abstractions
│   └── sync/        # Sync engine
├── flux-cli/        # Enhanced CLI
├── flux-gui/        # Modern GUI
└── flux-bench/      # Benchmarking toolkit
```

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Async Runtime
- **Choice**: Tokio (industry standard, great ecosystem)
- **Rationale**: Required for cloud operations, improves responsiveness

### 2. UI Framework Evolution
- **Current**: egui (immediate mode)
- **Enhancement**: Custom component layer on top of egui
- **Alternative considered**: Tauri (rejected due to rewrite cost)

### 3. Cloud Abstraction
- **Choice**: object_store crate
- **Rationale**: Unified API, well-maintained, production-ready

### 4. Security Model
- **Principle**: Defense in depth
- **Implementation**: Sandboxing, validation, secure defaults

## Success Metrics

### User Experience
- [ ] 90% of operations complete without errors
- [ ] Average task completion time reduced by 50%
- [ ] User satisfaction score > 4.5/5

### Technical
- [ ] 100% async APIs in core
- [ ] < 100ms UI response time
- [ ] Cloud operations at wire speed

### Market Position
- [ ] Featured compression tool on major platforms
- [ ] Active community with contributions
- [ ] Commercial licensing opportunities

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Async Migration Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Incremental refactoring, maintain sync adapters
   
2. **UI Performance with Large Archives**
   - Mitigation: Virtual scrolling, lazy loading

3. **Cloud Service Reliability**
   - Mitigation: Offline-first design, retry logic

### Project Risks
1. **Scope Creep**
   - Mitigation: Strict phase boundaries, MVP approach
   
2. **Backwards Compatibility**
   - Mitigation: Versioned APIs, migration tools

## Conclusion

Flux is positioned to evolve from a powerful compression tool to a comprehensive data archiving platform. By focusing on user experience, cloud integration, and unique features like the compression benchmarker, Flux will establish itself as the go-to solution for modern data archiving needs.

The journey ahead is ambitious but achievable through careful planning, iterative development, and a focus on delivering value at each phase.
