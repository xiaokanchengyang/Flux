# Milestone 1 Implementation Plan

## Overview
Milestone 1 focuses on expanding basic archive functionality and adding essential features for a production-ready tool.

## Planned Features

### 1. Archive Format Support
- [ ] Add ZIP archive support (read/write)
- [ ] Add gzip compression for tar archives (.tar.gz)
- [ ] Implement format detection based on file extension

### 2. Progress Indicators
- [ ] Integrate `indicatif` for progress bars
- [ ] Show progress during pack/extract operations
- [ ] Add file count and size information

### 3. Metadata Enhancement
- [ ] Improve cross-platform metadata handling
- [ ] Add symbolic link support with --follow-symlinks option
- [ ] Handle special files gracefully

### 4. CLI Improvements
- [ ] Implement --dry-run option
- [ ] Add --list option for archive inspection
- [ ] Improve error messages and user feedback

### 5. Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Add benchmarks for performance testing
- [ ] Expand integration test coverage
- [ ] Create user guide documentation

## Technical Details

### Dependencies to Add
- Already included in workspace: `indicatif`, `flate2`
- May need additional platform-specific dependencies

### Architecture Changes
- Refactor archive module to support multiple formats
- Create format-agnostic interface for pack/extract operations
- Implement streaming compression/decompression

### Performance Considerations
- Use buffered I/O for large files
- Implement parallel compression for multi-file archives
- Memory-mapped files for very large archives (future consideration)

## Timeline
Estimated completion: 3-5 days

## Success Criteria
- All tests passing on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- ZIP and tar.gz formats fully functional
- Progress bars working correctly
- No performance regression compared to Milestone 0
