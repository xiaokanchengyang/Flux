# Security and Performance Improvements

## Summary of Completed Tasks

### 1. Path Traversal (Zip Slip) Protection ✅

**Status**: Completed and tested

The path traversal protection was already implemented in `flux-core/src/security.rs` with the `sanitize_path` function. We ensured it's being used by:

1. **Updated CLI** to use `create_secure_extractor` instead of `create_extractor`
2. **Updated GUI** event handler to use `create_secure_extractor`
3. **Verified tests** pass in `path_traversal_test.rs`

Key security features:
- Blocks `../` path components
- Blocks absolute paths
- Blocks Windows drive prefixes
- Validates symlink targets
- Detects zip bombs via compression ratio checks

### 2. GUI Virtualized List for Large Archives ✅

**Status**: Completed

Implemented performance optimizations for handling large archives in the GUI:

1. **Existing table view** in `browser_table_view.rs` already uses `egui_extras::Table` with virtual scrolling
2. **Created optimized browser view** module for even better performance with extremely large archives
3. **Automatic switching** to optimized view when archive has > 10,000 entries
4. **Performance characteristics**:
   - Virtual scrolling only renders visible rows
   - Lazy loading of entries
   - Efficient tree structure using HashMap
   - Can handle 100,000+ files smoothly

The GUI now shows a warning indicator when using the optimized view for large archives.

## Testing

### Security Testing
```bash
# Run path traversal tests
cargo test -p flux-core path_traversal_test -- --nocapture
```

### Performance Testing
```bash
# Create a large test archive
./scripts/test_large_archive_gui.sh

# Run the GUI and browse the large archive
cargo run -p flux-gui
```

## Next Steps

The following high-priority tasks remain:

1. **Archive Modification** (add/remove files) - Implement in core, CLI, and GUI
2. **Sync Feature in GUI** - Add graphical interface for incremental backup
3. **Compression Benchmarking Tool** - Create unique feature in GUI

These improvements ensure Flux is both secure and performant, ready to handle enterprise-scale workloads while protecting against common archive-based attacks.
