# Flux Demo GIF Placeholder

This is a placeholder for the Flux demo GIF. 

To create the actual demo GIF:

2. Record a demo showing:
   - flux pack command with progress
   - flux extract command
   - flux inspect command
3. Convert to GIF format
4. Replace this file

The demo should demonstrate:
- Smart compression in action
- Progress bars
- Cross-platform usage
- Multiple file types being compressed optimally
